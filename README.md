## 🔍 Key Insights 

- ★ **USER INSIGHTS**  
  Majority of users belong to the 18–35 age group, indicating high digital adoption.

- ★ **TRANSACTION INSIGHTS**  
  Recharges, bill payments, and money transfers make up the bulk of PhonePe usage. Failures primarily occur due to network issues or insufficient balance.

- ★ **RECHARGE & BILLS**  
  Mobile recharges and electricity bill payments are the most common services. Many failed recharge/bill transactions are retried quickly.

- ★ **MONEY TRANSFER**  
  High-frequency transfers often happen between known users. Larger transfers have a higher success rate.

- ★ **LOANS**  
  Personal and small-credit loans are most used. Rejections mostly result from credit score issues or incomplete KYC.

- ★ **INSURANCE**  
  Health and vehicle insurance are the top categories. Premium payments show seasonal variation (e.g., festive peaks).
